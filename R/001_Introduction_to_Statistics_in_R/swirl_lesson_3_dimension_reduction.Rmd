In this lesson we'll discuss principal component analysis (PCA) and singular
 value decomposition (SVD), two important and related techniques of dimension
 reduction. This last entails processes which finding subsets of variables in
 datasets that contain their essences. PCA and SVD are used in both the
 exploratory phase and the more formal modelling stage of analysis. We'll focus
 on the exploratory phase and briefly touch on some of the underlying theory.

```{r}
library(readr)
dataMatrix <- read_csv("dataMatrix.csv")
head(dataMatrix)
```

```{r}
dataMatrix <- dataMatrix[, -1]
tempMatrix <- as.matrix(dataMatrix)
heatmap(tempMatrix)
```

We can see that even with the clustering that heatmap provides, permuting the
 rows (observations) and columns (variables) independently, the data still looks
 random.
