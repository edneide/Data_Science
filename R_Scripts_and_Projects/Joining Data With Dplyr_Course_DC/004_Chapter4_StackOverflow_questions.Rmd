## The questions table

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
questions <- read_csv("questions.csv", col_types = cols(creation_date = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d")))
question_tags <- read_csv("question_tags.csv")
tags <- read_csv("tags.csv")
answers <- read_csv("answers.csv", col_types = cols(creation_date = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d")))

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
head(questions)
```

```{r}
head(question_tags)
```

```{r}
head(tags)
```

## Joining data

```{r}
questions_with_tags <- questions %>% 
  inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>% 
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
questions_with_tags
```

## Most common tags

```{r}
questions_with_tags %>% 
  count(tag_name, sort = TRUE)
```

## Exercises

### **Left-joining questions and tags**

Three of the Stack Overflow survey datasets are `questions`, `question_tags`, and `tags`:

-   `questions`: an ID and the score, or how many times the question has been upvoted; the data only includes R-based questions

-   `question_tags`: a tag ID for each question and the question's id

-   `tags`: a tag id and the tag's name, which can be used to identify the subject of each question, such as ggplot2 or dplyr

In this exercise, we'll be stitching together these datasets and replacing NAs in important fields.

Note that we'll be using `left_join`s in this exercise to ensure we keep all questions, even those without a corresponding tag. However, since we know the `questions` data is all R data, we'll want to manually tag these as R questions with `replace_na`.

-   Join together `questions` and `question_tags` using the `id` and `question_id` columns, respectively.

```{r}
# Join the questions and question_tags tables
questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
    left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id"))
```

-   Use another join to add in the `tags` table.

```{r}
# Join in the tags table
questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
	left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
	left_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

-   Use `replace_na` to change the `NA`s in the `tag_name` column to `"only-r"`.

```{r}
# Replace the NAs in the tag_name column
questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
  left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
  left_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id")) %>%
  replace_na(list(tag_name = "only-r"))
```

### **Comparing scores across tags**

The complete dataset you created in the last exercise is available to you as `questions_with_tags`. Let's do a quick bit of analysis on it! You'll use familiar dplyr verbs like `group_by`, `summarize`, `arrange`, and `n` to find out the average score of the most asked questions.

-   Aggregate by the `tag_name`.

-   Summarize to get the total number of questions, `num_questions`, as well as the mean score for each question, `score`.

-   Arrange `num_questions` in descending order to sort the answers by the most asked questions.

```{r}
questions_with_tags %>%
	# Group by tag_name
	group_by(tag_name) %>%
	# Get mean score and num_questions
	summarize(score = mean(score),
          	  num_questions = n()) %>%
	# Sort num_questions in descending order
	arrange(desc(num_questions))
```

### **What tags never appear on R questions?**

The `tags` table includes all Stack Overflow tags, but some have nothing to do with `R`. How could you filter for just the tags that never appear on an R question? The `tags` and `question_tags` tables have been preloaded for you.

-   Use a join to determine which tags never appear on an R question.

```{r}
# Using a join, filter for tags that are never on an R question
tags %>%
  anti_join(question_tags, 
            by = c("id" = "tag_id"))
```

# Joining questions and answers

## The answers table

```{r}
head(answers)
```

```{r}
questions %>% 
  inner_join(answers, by = c("id" = "question_id"))
```

## Exercises

### **Finding gaps between questions and answers**

Now we'll join together `questions` with `answers` so we can measure the time between questions and answers.

Make sure to explore the tables and columns in the console before starting the exercise. Can you tell how are questions identified in the `questions` table? How can you identify which answer corresponds to which question using the `answers` table?

-   Use an inner join to combine the `questions` and `answers` tables using the suffixes `"_question"` and `"_answer"`, respectively.

-   Subtract `creation_date_question` from `creation_date_answer` within the `as.integer()` function to create the `gap` column.

***If your exercise is timing out, you are likely using the wrong columns for joining, causing the result to be too big! Check the join fields carefully!***

-   In the `questions` table, the questions are identified by the `id` column, and by the `question_id` in the `answers` table.

```{r}
questions %>%
	# Inner join questions and answers with proper suffixes
	inner_join(answers, by = c("id" = "question_id"), suffix = c("_question", "_answer")) %>% 
	# Subtract creation_date_question from creation_date_answer to create gap
	mutate(gap = as.integer(creation_date_answer - creation_date_question))
```

### **Joining question and answer counts**

We can also determine how many questions actually yield answers. If we count the number of answers for each question, we can then join the answers counts with the `questions` table.

-   Count and sort the `question_id` column in the `answers` table to create the `answer_counts` table.

-   Join the `questions` table with the `answer_counts` table.

-   Replace the NA values in the `n` column with 0s.

```{r}
# Count and sort the question id column in the answers table
answer_counts <- answers %>%
	group_by(question_id) %>%
	summarize(n = n())



# Combine the answer_counts and questions tables
questions %>% 
	left_join(answer_counts, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
	# Replace the NAs in the n column
	replace_na(list(n = 0))
```

### Joining questions, answers, and tags

Let's build on the last exercise by adding the tags table to our previous joins. This will allow us to do a better job of identifying which R topics get the most traction on Stack Overflow. The tables you created in the last exercise have been preloaded for you as answer_counts and question_answer_counts.

```{r}
answer_counts <- answers %>% count(question_id, sort = TRUE)

question_answer_counts <- questions %>% left_join(answer_counts, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>% replace_na(list(n = 0))
```

Combine the question_tags table with question_answer_counts using an inner_join. Now, use another inner_join to add the tags table.

```{r}
question_answer_counts %>%
	# Join the question_tags tables
	inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>% 
	# Join the tags table
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

### Average answers by question

The table you created in the last exercise has been preloaded for you as `tagged_answers`. You can use this table to determine, on average, how many answers each questions gets.

```{r}
tagged_answers <- question_answer_counts %>%
    inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
    inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

Some of the important variables from this table include: `n`, the number of answers for each question, and `tag_name`, the name of each tag associated with each question.

Let's use some of our favorite dplyr verbs to find out how many answers each question gets on average.

-   Aggregate the `tagged_answers` table by `tag_name`.

-   Summarize `tagged_answers` to get the count of `questions` and the `average_answers`.

-   Sort the resulting `questions` column in descending order.

```{r}
tagged_answers %>%
	# Aggregate by tag_name
  group_by(tag_name) %>%   
	# Summarize questions and average_answers
    summarize(questions = n(),
              average_answers = mean(n)) %>%
	# Sort the questions in descending order
  arrange(desc(questions))
```
